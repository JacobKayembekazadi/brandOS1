## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-01

## Context
Brand Central AI needs a deployment strategy that supports:
- Fast and reliable content delivery to global users
- Cost-effective hosting for MVP and scaling phases
- Easy deployment pipeline for rapid iteration
- HTTPS support for secure AI API communications
- Custom domain support for professional branding
- High availability and performance for user experience

Requirements:
- Static site hosting compatible with Vite build output
- Support for environment variable configuration
- CI/CD integration for automated deployments
- Global CDN for fast loading times
- Zero maintenance overhead for MVP stage
- Scalable to support growing user base

## Decision
We will use **Static Site Hosting with CDN (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel)** as our primary deployment strategy.

## Rationale

### Considered Options
1. **Static Site Hosting (GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel)** - CDN-powered static hosting
2. **Traditional Web Hosting (Apache/Nginx)** - Virtual private server hosting
3. **Cloud Storage + CDN (AWS S3 + CloudFront)** - Cloud-native static hosting
4. **Container Deployment (Docker + Kubernetes)** - Containerized deployment
5. **Serverless Platforms (Vercel Functions)** - Hybrid static + serverless

### Decision Factors

**Static Hosting Advantages:**
- **Zero Infrastructure Management**: No server maintenance or configuration
- **Global CDN**: Built-in content delivery networks for fast loading
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Free tiers for MVP, pay-as-you-scale pricing
- **HTTPS by Default**: Automatic SSL certificates and security
- **Git Integration**: Direct deployment from GitHub repository
- **Instant Deployments**: Fast deployment pipeline (30 seconds to live)
- **High Availability**: Enterprise-grade uptime guarantees

**Platform Comparison:**
| Feature | GitHub Pages | Netlify | Vercel | AWS S3+CDN |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------|------------|
| Cost (MVP) | Free | Free | Free | ~$1-5/month |
| Custom Domain | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| HTTPS | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Build Pipeline | Limited | ✅ | ✅ | Manual |
| Environment Variables | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Manual |
| Preview Deployments | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**Why Not Others:**
- **Traditional Hosting**: Server maintenance overhead, security management, limited scalability
- **Container Deployment**: Overkill for static app, high operational complexity
- **Pure Cloud Storage**: Manual deployment pipeline, limited CI/CD integration

## Implementation Strategy

### Primary Platform: Vercel (Recommended)
```yaml
# vercel.json
{
  "framework": "vite",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "env": {
    "GEMINI_API_KEY": "@gemini_api_key"
  }
}
```

### Fallback Platform: Netlify
```toml
# netlify.toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Alternative: GitHub Pages
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
        env:
          GEMINI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```
