# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Brand Central AI project. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, and their consequences.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They help teams understand:

- **Why** certain decisions were made
- **What** alternatives were considered  
- **When** the decision was made
- **What** the consequences are

## Current ADRs

## ADR Statuses

- **üü¢ Accepted** - Decision has been made and implemented
- **üü° Proposed** - Decision is under consideration
- **üî¥ Deprecated** - Decision has been superseded by a newer ADR
- **‚ùå Rejected** - Decision was considered but not adopted

## When to Create an ADR

Create a new ADR when making decisions about:

- **Technology Stack**: Choosing frameworks, libraries, or tools
- **Architecture Patterns**: State management, routing, component structure
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment, hosting, CI/CD pipelines
- **Data Management**: Persistence, APIs, synchronization
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Performance**: Optimization strategies, caching, bundling

## ADR Template

Use this template for new ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Rejected]

## Date
YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Rationale
### Considered Options
1. Option 1 - Brief description
2. Option 2 - Brief description  
3. Option 3 - Brief description

### Decision Factors
Why did we choose this option? What are the advantages?

**Why Not Others:**
- Option 1: Reason for rejection
- Option 2: Reason for rejection

## Consequences
### Positive
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

### Negative  
- Drawback 1
- Drawback 2

### Risk Mitigation
- How we'll address the risks and drawbacks

## Implementation
Details about how this decision is implemented.
```

## Updating ADRs

### When an ADR becomes outdated:

1. **Don't edit the original ADR** - ADRs are historical records
2. **Create a new ADR** that supersedes the old one
3. **Update the old ADR's status** to "Deprecated" 
4. **Add a link** in the old ADR pointing to the new one

### Example deprecation note:
```markdown
## Status
Deprecated - Superseded by [ADR-015: New State Management](./015-new-state-management.md)
```

## Best Practices

### Writing ADRs
- **Keep them concise** - Usually 1-3 pages
- **Focus on the decision** - Not implementation details
- **Include context** - Why was this decision needed?
- **Document alternatives** - What else was considered?
- **Be specific about consequences** - Both positive and negative
- **Use simple language** - Accessible to all team members

### Maintaining ADRs
- **Review regularly** - Are decisions still valid?
- **Update status when needed** - Mark deprecated/rejected decisions
- **Reference in code** - Link to relevant ADRs in code comments
- **Include in onboarding** - New team members should read ADRs

## Review Process

1. **Draft ADR** - Author creates initial version
2. **Team Review** - Discuss with development team
3. **Stakeholder Input** - Get feedback from relevant stakeholders
4. **Decision** - Mark as Accepted/Rejected
5. **Implementation** - Execute the decision
6. **Monitor** - Track consequences and update if needed

## Tools and Resources

- **ADR Tools**: [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for command-line ADR management
- **Templates**: [ADR GitHub](https://adr.github.io/) for more templates and examples
- **Integration**: Consider integrating ADRs into your documentation workflow

## Questions?

If you have questions about any architectural decisions:

1. **Check the relevant ADR** - Most context should be documented
2. **Ask the team** - Discuss during architecture reviews
3. **Update the ADR** - If missing information, propose an update

## Contributing

To contribute a new ADR:

1. Copy the template above
2. Replace XXX with the next sequential number
3. Fill in all sections thoughtfully
4. Open a pull request for team review
5. Update this README when the ADR is accepted

*Remember: ADRs are living documents that help us learn from our decisions and maintain architectural consistency across the project.*
