# ADR-001: Frontend Framework Choice

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-01

## Context
We need to choose a frontend framework for Brand Central AI that supports:
- Complex UI state management for multi-phase brand development
- Real-time AI integration with dynamic content generation
- Component reusability across multiple modules
- Strong TypeScript support for type safety
- Rapid development and iteration
- Large ecosystem for future integrations

## Decision
We will use **React 19** as our primary frontend framework.

## Rationale

### Considered Options
1. **React 19** - Latest React with modern features
2. **Vue 3** - Progressive framework with Composition API
3. **Angular 17** - Full framework with enterprise features
4. **Svelte** - Compile-time optimized framework

### Decision Factors

**React 19 Advantages:**
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Largest component library ecosystem
- **TypeScript Integration**: Excellent TypeScript support out of the box
- **Concurrent Features**: React 18+ concurrent rendering for AI response handling
- **Hooks System**: Perfect for complex state management without external libraries
- **Community Support**: Largest developer community and resources
- **AI Library Support**: Best support for AI/ML integrations
- **Future-Proof**: Backing by Meta ensures long-term support

**Why Not Others:**
- **Vue 3**: Smaller ecosystem for AI integrations, less enterprise adoption
- **Angular**: Too heavy for MVP, steep learning curve, overkill for current needs
- **Svelte**: Smaller ecosystem, limited AI integration libraries

## Consequences

### Positive
- Access to rich ecosystem of React components and libraries
- Excellent TypeScript integration reduces development bugs
- Hooks enable clean state management without additional libraries
- Large talent pool for future hiring
- Strong community support for problem-solving
- Excellent performance with concurrent features for AI interactions

### Negative
- Larger bundle size compared to Svelte
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with React patterns
- Rapid ecosystem changes require staying updated

### Risk Mitigation
- Use React 19 stable features only, avoid experimental APIs
- Implement proper bundle splitting to manage size
- Establish coding standards and component patterns early
- Plan for regular dependency updates

## Implementation
- Initialize project with React 19.1.0
- Configure TypeScript for strict type checking
- Implement component architecture with shared UI library
- Use React Router for navigation
- Leverage React Hooks for state management
